# Weather-Web-App
Web dev project using a JSON API and some Javascript.

## Status
Web service given by freeCodeCamp seems to be very unreliable. Frequently fails to properly fulfill a request on page load. However, this also could be due to some mistake of my own that I am unaware of. When it does decide to work, background and weather stats are displayed properly.
